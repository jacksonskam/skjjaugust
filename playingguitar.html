    2025/02/13 - The Death of Queen Jane. This one is an old English folk song that has been widely covered but this arrangement is most akin to Oscar Isaac's from the movie <i>Inside Llewyn Davis</i>. Joan Baez also has a great cover of this as well. I really love the story of this song and its historical references to King Henry VIII and one of his wives Jane Seymour who was the only of Henry's wives to receive a burial after she died from postnatal complications two weeks after giving birth to the future King Edward VI. The song's female perspective is a great flip from the usual male-dominated retelling of history.

    2025/02/13 - When The Ship Comes In by Bob Dylan. One of my fav Bob songs, and Timothee Chalamet does a great cover for A Complete Unknown with Ed Norton!

    2024/12/31 - The opening to Great Balls of Fire by Jerry Lee Lewis on my great-grandma's piano. HOWEVER, this is a case of separating art from artist as Jerry Lee Lewis is truly a weirdo! (Also I guess this isn't guitar but whatever lol)
